# SpaceRacewithDataScience
Final Coursera Project report to get IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. 

## Context
I assumed the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting the results to stakeholders.  

The main goal is predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully, with the help of Data Science findings and models, to make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
